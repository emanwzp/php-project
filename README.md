# php-project
This was a project with no main purpose except to improve my PHP skills. I started with a basic main page that tested database insertion and database access in SQL. 
It ended up with multiple pages where each one built on different skills and specific techniques. 
One of the good things about this project was that i was able to build a scratch map where I could select which countries I had visited, or even mark them as wish to visit, 
which changes could also be saved in the database, this was something that I thought was a great exercise to improve my programming skills as I used PHP, 
javascript and SQL to achieve this
